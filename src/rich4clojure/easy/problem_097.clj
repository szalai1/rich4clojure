;; = Pascal's Triangle =
;; By 4Clojure user: dbyrne
;; Difficulty: Easy
;; 
;; Pascal's triangle is a triangle of numbers computed
;; using the following rules:
;; 
;; 
;; - The first row is 1.
;; 
;; - Each successive row is computed by adding together
;; adjacent numbers in the row above, and adding a 1 to
;; the beginning and end of the row.
;; 
;; 
;; Write a function which returns the nth row of Pascal's
;; Triangle.
